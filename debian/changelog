ski (1.1.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Clone and go from the old ski code
  * updated versioning in preparation for a surge of bug fixes and
    such (affected a lot of files this way)
  * Removed bogus libski package (this package uses no dynamic
    linking at all -- and should not)
  * Lots of packaging fix-ups (mostly bit-rot types of things)

ski (0.981-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Verified and corrected code so that Konstantin's patch (as
    modified by David) for getPty() is now included.

ski (0.981-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added distributable version of the ski user's manual picked up 
    from hp's external web; see /usr/share/doc/ski/ski-manual-v1.0.pdf.

ski (0.981-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated to latest CVS top-of-tree
  * src/write.c (cfmWrt): Restore the original value of "sof" before
    calling rse_new_frame().  That call may longjmp() if a data-debug
    breakpoint is hit and when that happens, the simulator state must
    be consistent.  Once rse_new_frame() returns successfully,
    re-establish the new "sof" value.
  * src/state.c: Change family from 7 (Merced) to 0x1f (McKinley/Madison).
  * src/ui.c (regwtbl): Change height of System Registers info from 43 to
    64 lines.  (srLine): Adapt to make room for 64 PMC and PMD registers
    (man, this code is in need of a rewrite!!).
  * src/ssDSym.c: Add include of "state.h" so we get NPMS defined.
    (isymInit): For PMCs/PMDs, call isymIns2() with -NPMS instead of -16.
  * src/libcore.h (NPMS): Increase from 16 to 64 so we get 64 PMCs and PMDs
    (like on Montecito).
  * src/state.h (NPMS): Likewise.
  * misc/ia64fmt: use modprobe instead of insmod to load binfmt_misc

ski (0.981-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * src/tlb.h (DBGREGS): Define to enable debug registers support.
  * src/ssDSym.c (isymInit): Define ar.csd as an ia64 register instead of
    an ia32 register.
  * src/main.c (main): Allow environment variable SKI_PAGE_SIZE to override
    simulated page-size.  This is a bit of a kludge to work around the 
    data-breakpoint limit, which are limited to covering a single 
    (simulated) page.
  * configure.ac: Check for XtRealloc instead of XtMalloc.
    (CFLAGS): Compiled with -fno-strict-aliasing to avoid potential bad
    code (Ski isn't strict-aliasing safe).

ski (0.981-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated to latest upstream source. 
  * Forced static linking to avoid problems with forcing particular
    versions of some libraries (such as libbfd) to be used.

 -- Al Stone <ahs3@fc.hp.com>  Mon, 19 Jan 2004 20:40:55 -0700

ski (0.981-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Corrected the link path for ski by using --with-gnu-ld in the
    configure step of debian/rules, and then using chrpath to remove
    the rpath inserted by libtool (because libtool *insists* on using
    -rpath, which is fine for static objects, but not for the dynamic
    objects Debian prefers).
  * Corrected misc/ia64fmt; linda reported 'dash -n' errors that I
    missed.

ski (0.981-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Made the version number correspond to what's actually used in
    src/version.h.
  * Updated to latest source.  Corrections made to src/ssDDM.c and
    to src/linux/syscall-linux.c were incorporated as a result.
  * Corrected the misc/ia64fmt script that tells the kernel to use
    ski as an ia64 interpreter; it needed to be better about the
    cases where binfmt_misc may not yet be mounted.
  * The x86 version was not installing the etc/init.d/ski script
    at all.  Fixed the rules file.

ski (0.9.81-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated to latest version of source tree.
  * Added required force-reload option to init.d script that installs
    bski as an interpreter for ia64 executables.
  * Corrected typos (wrong paths) in misc/ia64fmt and misc/bskinc.
  * Created ia64 debs, on top of ia32 debs.
  * Added into debian/rules a test to see if we're building an ia64
    version of ski; if so, do _not_ install the init.d script that
    registers ski as the program to interpret ia64 executables --
    this would be very bad.

 -- Al Stone <ahs3@fc.hp.com>  Fri, 18 Apr 2003 11:37:43 -0600

ski (0.9.81-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added in the /etc/init.d/ia64fmt script to register ski as an
    interpreter for ia64 binaries.  This also required the addition
    of the bskinc script (bski with no console).
  * Added in a dependency on less (used for the license display)

ski (0.9.81-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Missed some of the build-depends (automake1.7, libtool, debhelper,
    ...); found them by making sure testing within debootstrap environments
    succeeded.
  * This package cannot be built with woody; the dependency on automake1.7
    is quite strong.  This package can also not be built on testins, since
    it needs bug fixes done in debhelper 4.0.4.  Unstable builds fine.

 -- Al Stone <ahs3@fc.hp.com>  Tue, 18 Mar 2003 22:32:48 -0700

ski (0.9.81-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed to package structure pretty dramatically; separated out
    the run-time library in libski, the development files into
    libski-dev, and the commands into a simpler ski package.
  * Made sure all the build-depends were specified properly

 -- Al Stone <ahs3@fc.hp.com>  Tue, 18 Mar 2003 16:59:44 -0700

ski (0.9.81-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated to most recent source tree
  * Used a more proper version numbering scheme (0.9.81 vs 0.981).
  * Had to export a value for the variable SED in debian/rules so
    that the homegrown version of libtool being used would work
  * Cleaned up the installation a bit so that it would pass lintian

 -- Al Stone <ahs3@fc.hp.com>  Tue, 18 Mar 2003 15:15:05 -0700

ski (0.9.77-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial release.
