TODO:

-- Glue the test suite back together

-- Are all of the bugs cleaned up?

-- check BitfR usage (replace everything w/ BitfX and fix the errors...)

-- think about making the trcread program available

-- /etc/init.d/ia64fmt may need to do "modprobe binfmt_misc" before trying
   to register the simlautor; at least, this seems to be necessary on RH7.2
   -- in Debian, use update-binfmt, instead

-- convert the GUI to GTK or something more common than Motif

-- make sure latest instruction set (SDM2.2) is supported

-- redo the documentation

-- add some HOWTOs (e.g., HOWTO use ski with xen)

-- integrate into qemu somehow?

-- graft ski and gdb together?
